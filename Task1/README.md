Build map_splay_tree + unit-tests + gtest:
	cmake -G "<your_platform>"
All build files will be in build/
! gtest may compile with warnings

Run all unit-tests:
	./build/task1
or go to build/ and run ./task1

If your want build only map_splay_tree library:
go to src/ and run cmake


Files locations:
map_splay_tree sources are in src/
